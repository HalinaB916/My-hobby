            Salsa is one of the most popular types Latin dances that is practiced worldwide. The term "salsa" was coined by
            Johnny Pacheco in the 1960s in New York, as an umbrella term for Cuban dance music being played in the city at the
            time. Salsa as a dance emerged soon after, being a combination of mambo (which was popular in New York in the 1950s)
            as well as Latin dances such as Son and Rumba as well as American dances such as swing, hustle, and tap.
            
            Like many other forms of Latin dances, salsa may trace its roots back to Cuba, where it is widely accepted that early
            radio is responsible for American artists to begin incorporating elements of Latin American rhythms into their own music
            and eventually into their own styles of dance.
            
            As salsa music spread to other countries, different styles emerged such as Cuban and Colombian salsa. Salsa remains
            popular globally with enthnographic research into salsa having been done as far as Benin, and Ghana.
